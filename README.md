# Inertia - Spring Boot

This is a minimal implementation of the [Inertia protocol](https://inertiajs.com/the-protocol) in Spring Boot, and a
sample app using Inertia for displaying counters with their state stored server-side inside an in-memory DB.

I'm not planing to build this into a complete or production ready library (skill issue), so feel free to fork/copy it. Protocol is actually
simple, so completing the implementation shouldn't be hard either.

You should 
```shell
cd frontend
bun run build
#npm probably works too
```
before running the Spring Boot app
