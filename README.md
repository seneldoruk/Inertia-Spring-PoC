# Inertia - Spring Boot

This is a minimal implementation of the Inertia protocol in Spring Boot, and a sample app using the Inertia class for
displaying counters with their state stored in the server. I'm not planing to build this into a complete or production
ready library (skill issue), so feel free to fork/copy it. Protocol is actually simple, so completing the implementation
shouldn't be hard either.
