# Inertia - Spring Boot

This is a minimal implementation of the [Inertia protocol](https://inertiajs.com/the-protocol) in Spring Boot, and a
sample app using the Inertia for displaying counters with their state stored in the server. I'm not planing to
build this into a complete or production ready library (skill issue), so feel free to fork/copy it. Protocol is actually
simple, so completing the implementation shouldn't be hard either.
